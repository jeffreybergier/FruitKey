A Simple Keyboard for Typing 

I wrote this to learn Swift and to learn iOS8 extensions. I apologize if a lot of the Swift code is shoddy. At this time, I didn't know very many of Swift's features.

This keyboard is meant to help us type in the  (Apple Symbol) so I could talk about Apple's new products. I submitted it to the store but it was rejected for using Apple's logo as the primary function of the app. Which I understand. 

So I'm putting this on here for free to everyone. Its under MIT License and you use it at your own risk. Feel free to download, build and run on your devices or your friends. Please don't submit it to the app store in its current form without contacting me first.

Enjoy!
